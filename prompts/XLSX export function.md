I've implemented the XLSX export functionality for the Aangifte IB tab based on the R implementation:

Backend (xlsx_export.py):

XLSXExportProcessor class that replicates the R functions

make_ledgers() - Calculates starting balance and adds transactions for specific year/administration

export_files() - Creates folder structure for reference numbers

write_workbook() - Writes data to Excel using template.xlsx

API endpoint /api/reports/aangifte-ib-xlsx-export

Frontend:

New "Export XLSX Jaarrapportage" section in Aangifte IB tab

Multi-select dropdowns for administrations and years

"Generate XLSX Files" button that creates one file per administration/year combination

Files are saved to C:\Users\peter\OneDrive\Admin\reports\{Administration}{Year}\

Key Features:

Uses vw_mutaties table as data source

Calculates beginning balance for balance accounts (VW = N) from all previous years

Includes all transactions for the selected year

Creates folder structure for reference numbers

Uses template.xlsx if available, creates new workbook otherwise

Maintains Excel formatting and adds autofilter

Shows success/error feedback to user

The implementation follows the R script logic:

Calculate starting balance for balance accounts (VW = N) from years before target year

Add all transactions from the target year

Create Excel file with proper formatting

Create folder structure for organizing documents
