1. From a sql backup restore removed urls for missing gdrive invoices (mainly jpg/png) using id only where there was an url and no longer now.
2. Create a file missing invoices with id, date, reference, url, filename for all urls starting with google where the url does no longer exist
3. Contact google support with the question how they can be deleted and if there is a way to get them recovered.
4. Define a regular check to validate if urls exist and if not create list of missing urls. Check in trash and if not contact google support.
