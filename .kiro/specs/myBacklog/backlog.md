# Time tracking

- Quick add part
  -- Missing product or NOT

## Recalculation of balance sheet for validation
Out of scope: Full recalculation mode (reading all years while excluding OpeningBalance records) is a separate audit/verification feature to be wired into tenant administration as its own deliverable. See future spec: balance-verification-audit.


## ZZP Modal to manage trip presets
The database has an is_manual boolean field on each preset:

is_manual = true → user-created via the management UI
is_manual = false → auto-learned from trip history
Both show up equally on the Quick Entry screen — the user doesn't need to care how a preset was created. They just see their routes sorted by usage frequency.

Where the distinction matters:

Scenario	Manual	Auto-learned
Shown in Quick Entry	✓ (always)	✓ (top X by use_count)
User can edit	✓	✓
User can delete	✓	✓
Gets pruned if unused for 6 months	No	Yes (falls off the top X)
Created before first trip	✓ (plan ahead)	✗ (needs trips first)
So the practical value of manual presets: you can add a route you will drive (new client, new office) before you've actually driven it. Auto-learned ones only appear after you've used the route.

In the management UI, you could show a small badge ("Handmatig" / "Geleerd") to distinguish them visually, but it's purely informationa
